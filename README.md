# The Enigma Project

## Description
The aim of this project is to allow players to step in the boots of the code breakers in Bletchley Park and do their best to break the German encryption codes and save the Allies!

## Usage

Players can participate in both Singleplayer and Multiplayer modes where the latter allows them to play as the United Kingdom or Germany.

In order to begin a game, the player should navigate to the Home page and click on the 'Start Game' button. Then they'll be asked to choose whether they want to play in Singleplayer or Multiplayer. Choosing Singleplayer will take the player straight to game whereas choosing Multiplayer will take them to the Faction and Mode selection screen.

For a more comprehensive guide on how to play, please visit our youtube channel where we have posted tutorials on both Singleplayer and Multiplayer:
